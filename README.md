DMAssassins-1.0
===============

[Assassins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin_(game)) is Live Action Game where players are assigned a target to "kill" by shooting them with Silly Stringâ„¢. The game runs in a giant loop (picture a circular linked list), and players continue to "kill" their targets until only one player is left.

This version of DMAssassins was written for [Dance Marathon at the University of Florida](http://floridadm.org) to be played as a fundraising activity in 2011 and raised a couple hundred dollars in admission fees. It was my first ever webapp and I learned PHP and CSS for this project.

The UI is clearly lacking and it almost all of the forms are open to SQL injection however I was once quite proud of this code. I have a running demo available [here](http://apps.mattgerstman.com/Assassins1). You can log in with the username "mgerstman" and password "password".

Some of the cooler features include a working admin panel and a twitter engine. When a player died the app would automatically tweet a funny way that player "died."

This was later replaced by [DMAssassins-2.0](https://github.com/mattgerstman/DMAssassins-2.0) and the current version [DMAssassins](https://dmassassins.com).
